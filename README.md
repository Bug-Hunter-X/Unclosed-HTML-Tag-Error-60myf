# Unclosed HTML Tag Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in HTML: an unclosed tag. This can lead to unexpected rendering issues and difficult-to-debug problems.

## Bug

The `bug.html` file contains an unclosed `div` tag. This causes the browser to misinterpret the subsequent HTML structure, potentially leading to styling problems and incorrect rendering.

## Solution

The `solution.html` file demonstrates the corrected code with the `div` tag properly closed. This resolves the rendering issues and ensures the webpage behaves as expected.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser. Observe the incorrect rendering.
3. Open `solution.html` in a web browser. Observe the correct rendering.
