<p>This is a common error in HTML that can be difficult to track down. It occurs when you have an unclosed tag, which causes the browser to misinterpret the rest of your HTML code.</p><p>Here is an example of such an error:</p><code><div><p>This is a paragraph.</p></code><p>In this example, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is not closed, which will lead to unexpected behavior on your webpage. For instance, elements after the unclosed div may inherit unintended styles, rendering the page incorrectly.</p>
